            <h3><a href="https://example.com/relyvin" target="_blank">Relyvin:</a></h3>
            <p>Over the summer, I launched a medical tourism startup called Relyvin, a platform designed to connect international clients with high-quality healthcare providers abroad. The platform was built from scratch, integrating user-centered design principles to enhance the client experience and utilizing automation tools to streamline partner engagement. Through a network of clinics overseas, we were able to quickly establish connections in key locations, providing clients with reliable options for medical care in other countries. Within the first three months, we scaled to over 5,000 monthly active users and generated $8,000 in revenue-all achieved on a $0 marketing budget.<br><br> Tech Stack: React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Python, Selenium, Twilio, AWS EC2, Docker, Celery, RabbitMQ</p>

            <h3><a href="https://example.com/dropai" target="_blank">DropAI:</a></h3>
            <p>At Hack MIT, my team and I created DropAI, an AI-powered email automation tool designed to streamline client communications and document management. This tool autonomously handles routine inquiries, initiates document signing, and completes repetitive administrative tasks. By automating these processes, DropAI saves users an estimated 21+ hours each week. With a focus on high-quality responses and fast processing, DropAI optimizes workflow efficiency for busy professionals.<br><br>Tech Stack: Python, Flask, OpenAI API, HTML, JavaScript</p>

            <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Go Follow Yourself:</a></h3>
            <p>This started as a personal project born from my frustration with Instagram. I realized I was following many accounts that weren't following me back, and keeping track of that was tedious. So, I built a tool to automate it. The tool scrapes Instagram to identify unfollowers and then sends monthly email lists with their usernames.

                What surprised me was how quickly others got interested. After I shared it with a few friends, word spread, and soon my classmates were asking for access. Within a week, it had over 100 users, all of whom appreciated the simplicity and usefulness of the tool. Building this project taught me a lot about scaling a small tool to meet unexpected demand, as well as handling privacy and automation with real-time user feedback.<br><br> Tech Stack: Python, Selenium</p>
